Hi, I am a first year PhD student in [Computer Science](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/) at [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/).

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Nitin Saxena](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/nitin/). Prior to this I was at [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/) where I was advised by [Partha Mukhopadhyay](https://www.cmi.ac.in/~partham/)


Research Interests
======
I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science and in particular Computational Complexity.
