Hi, I am a postdoctoral fellow hosted by [Radu Curticapean](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/en/informatics-data-science/faculty/facilities/algorithms-and-complexity-theory/team/radu-curticapean) at the [University of Regensburg](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/). I did my PhD at [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Nitin Saxena](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/nitin/). Before that, I began my journey into Theoretical Computer Science at [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/), guided by [Partha Mukhopadhyay](https://www.cmi.ac.in/~partham/).


Research Interests
======
I am broadly interested in Theoretical Computer Science and, in particular, Computational Complexity. I like thinking about problems with an algebraic flavor.
